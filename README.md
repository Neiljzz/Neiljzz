### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Neil!ðŸ˜‰

Hi, I'm Zhengze Jia, also known as Neil. I'm a product designer with a Master of Fine Arts in Design for Social Innovation. With expertise in both design and coding, I create products that are effective, user-friendly, and solve real-world problems. My technology stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flask, MySQL,Python and Express. I'm proficient in design tools like Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, Figma, and Miro. I also have experience working as a product designer at Tencent, where I honed my skills in creating B2C products.

My passion lies in taking a user-centered approach to design and finding new ways to improve the user experience. Whether it's conducting user research or testing new design patterns, I'm constantly striving to learn and grow. I'm excited to work with other designers, developers, and product managers to create innovative and impactful products that make a difference in people's lives.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more advanced coding concepts and exploring new design trends to stay up-to-date with the latest industry standards.
 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that combine design and coding to create innovative products that solve real-world problems.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving my coding skills and learning new technologies that will enhance my design capabilities.
